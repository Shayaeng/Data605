# Q1

The price of one share of stock in the Pilsdorff Beer Company is given by $Yn$ on the $n$th day of the year. Finn observes that the differences $X_n = Y_{n+1} - Y_n$ appear to be independent random variables with a common distribution having mean $µ = 0$ and variance $σ^2 = 1/4$. If $Y_1 = 100$, estimate the probability that $Y_{365}$ is: (a) ≥ 100. (b) ≥ 110. (c) ≥ 120.

```{r}
# Given parameters
mean <- 100 # givent he mu is 0, all the values of Yn will be 100
sd <- sqrt(1/4) # given the variance is 1/4
n <- 365 # number of days

# (a) Probability that Y_365 >= 100
prob_a <- pnorm(100, mean, sd * sqrt(n)) # using the CLT to calculate the probability as a normal distribution
cat("Probability that Y_365 >= 100:", prob_a, "\n")

# (b) Probability that Y_365 >= 110
prob_b <- pnorm(110, mean, sd * sqrt(n))
cat("Probability that Y_365 >= 110:", prob_b, "\n")

# (c) Probability that Y_365 >= 120
prob_c <- pnorm(120, mean, sd * sqrt(n))
cat("Probability that Y_365 >= 120:", prob_c, "\n")
```

# Q2

**Calculate the expected value and variance of the binomial distribution using the moment generating function.**

The moment generating function of the binomial distribution is given by: $$M(t) = (1 - p + pe^t)^n$$

### Expected value

The expected value $E[X]$ of a random variable $X$ is given by the first derivative of the MGF evaluated at $t = 0$:

$$ E[X] = M_X'(0) $$

Taking the derivative of $M_X(t)$ with respect to $t = 0$:

$$ M_X'(t) = npe^0(pe^0 + 1 - p)^{n-1} $$

$$ M_X'(0) = np $$

Therefore, the expected value of the binomial distribution is $np$.

### variance

The variance $Var(X)$ of a random variable $X$ is given by the second derivative of the MGF evaluated at $t = 0$ plus the square of the expected value:

$$ Var(X) = M_X''(0) + [M_X'(0)]^2 $$

Taking the second derivative of $M_X(t)$ with respect to $t = 0$:

$$ M_X''(0) = npe^0(pe^0 + 1 - p)^{n-1} + np^2e^{2 * 0}(pe^0 + 1 - p)^{n-2} $$

$$ M_X''(0) = np + np^2 $$

$$ M_X'(0) = np $$

Plugging these values into the variance formula:

$$ Var(X) = np + np^2 + (np)^2 $$

$$ Var(X) = np + np^2 + n^2p^2 $$

$$ Var(X) = np(1-p) $$

Therefore, the variance of the binomial distribution is $np(1-p)$.

# Q3

**Calculate the expected value and variance of the exponential distribution using the moment generating function.**

For the exponential distribution with rate parameter $\lambda$, the PDF is given by:

$$ f(x|\lambda) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x} $$

The MGF of the exponential distribution is:

$$ M_X(t) = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda - t} \quad \text{for } t < \lambda $$

### Expected value

The expected value $E[X]$ of a random variable $X$ is given by the first derivative of the MGF evaluated at $t = 0$:

$$ E[X] = -M_X'(0) $$

$$ E[X] = -\left(-\frac{\lambda}{\lambda^2}\right) = \frac{1}{\lambda} $$

Therefore, the expected value of the exponential distribution is $\frac{1}{\lambda}$.

### Variance

The variance $Var(X)$ of a random variable $X$ is given by the second derivative of the MGF evaluated at $t = 0$, plus the square of the expected value:

$$ Var(X) = M_X''(0) + (E[X])^2 $$

The second derivative of the MGF is:

$$ M_X''(t) = \frac{2\lambda}{(\lambda - t)^3} $$

$$ M_X''(0) = \frac{2}{\lambda^2} $$

$$ Var(X) = \frac{2}{\lambda^2} + \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{\lambda^2} $$

Therefore, the variance of the exponential distribution is $\frac{2}{\lambda^2}$.
